The GUIDE-Seq (Genome-wide Unbiased Identification of Double-strand breaks Enabled by Sequencing) method enables comprehensive detection and quantification of off-target activity by capturing double-strand breaks across the genome through oligonucleotide tagging, followed by sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.

# Reads alignment, cut sites calling and clustering

Summary of the alignment step, calling step and clustering of cutting sites including :

-   The number of reads aligned on the genome

-   The number of UMIs detected (estimation of total number of events)

-   The number of unique ODN insertion sites

-   The number of clusters.

# Best match(es)

For each library, the best match(es) are clusters with the minimal number of edits in the gRNA and PAM sequences ( which may not necessarily be 0 ).

```{r,echo=F}
kbl(best_aligns %>% 
      arrange(library) %>% 
      mutate("Cut offset" = as.numeric(cut_modal_position) - as.numeric(cut_gRNa_alignment),.after = chromosome) %>% 
      select(-clusterID,-cut_modal_position) %>% 
      unite("Position",chromosome,cut_gRNa_alignment,sep=":"),
                      caption = "Table 4",

## Rank-abundance curve

The rank-abundance curve provides insights into relative cluster abundance - a steep curve indicates dominance by a few clusters, while a shallow curve suggests more even distribution among different clusters.

```{r,fig.width=12, fig.height=ceiling(libraries_count/3)*3,fig.align='center',fig.format='png', echo=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fig.cap="Figure 1"}

fig_RankAbundance
```

> -   Only clusters with gRNA match and more than **`r config$minUMI_alignments_figure`** total UMIs are plotted.
>
> -   `Red` dots correspond to clusters with `minimal edits` (see table 4).
>
> -   Top3 most abundant clusters (UMI counts) are labeled.

## Distribution of cut sites around best candidates position

For each best candidate cluster, plot the UMI count detected around the gRNA theoretical cut site (dashed line) for each cut site, in the forward or reverse ODN orientation (blue and red bars respectively).

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=ceiling(nrow(best_aligns)/3)*2, fig.align='center', fig.format='png', echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Figure 2"}

# Genome distribution of clusters

This figure represents the distribution of unique clusters `with gRNA` match per chromosome, colored by `prediction` status. Only clusters with number of edits (INDELs and substitutions) smaller or equal to **`r config$max_edits_crRNA`** are considered.

```{r,fig.width=12, fig.height=ceiling(libraries_count/3)*4,fig.align='center',fig.format='png', echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "figure 3"}
fig_ChromDistr_clusters
```

This figure represents the total number of UMIs (cells) per chromosome from clusters with gRNA match, colored by `prediction` status. Only clusters with number of edits (INDELs and substitutions) smaller or equal to **`r config$max_edits_crRNA`** are considered.
